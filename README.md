**dVLM-AD** formulates autonomous driving decision-making as a **conditional diffusion process over actions**, enabling bidirectional context reasoning, improved robustness to uncertainty, and stronger reasoning–action consistency compared to autoregressive vision-language models.

## Environment Setup

We recommend using **conda** to manage the environment.

### Create and activate environment

```bash
conda create -n dvlm python=3.10 -y
bash init_env.sh
````

---

## Running Inference

### Prepare model checkpoint

Download the [checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/gray311/dVLM-AD_waymo/tree/main) and place it under:

```text
checkpoints/
```

Checkpoint download links will be provided on the project website.

---

### Run inference

```bash
cd eval
python inference.py \
```

This script will generate:

* Driving action trajectories
* Reasoning process associated with each trajectory
